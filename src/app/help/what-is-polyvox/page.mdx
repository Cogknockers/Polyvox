# What Is Polyvox?

Polyvox is a civic operating system.

It is not a social media platform for politics, and it is not a campaign tool by default.

Polyvox helps communities:
- document real civic problems
- identify who is responsible
- build public evidence over time
- detect when the same problems repeat across places
- escalate issues to the level of government that can actually fix them

Most civic platforms flatten everything into one loud room.
Polyvox is different: it mirrors how government actually works.

Change starts local.
Polyvox is built so it can travel upward.
