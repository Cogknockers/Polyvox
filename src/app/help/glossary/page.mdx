# Polyvox Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used in Polyvox that may not be familiar to the general public.
These definitions are specific to Polyvox and may differ from how similar words are used elsewhere.

---

## Civic Ladder

The core structure of Polyvox.

The Civic Ladder reflects how government actually works, with issues and solutions able to move upward through levels of governance:

City → County → State → National

Issues begin locally and can only escalate when evidence and repetition justify it.
Escalation is earned, not viral.

---

## Jurisdiction

A defined area of governance.

In Polyvox, every piece of content belongs to a jurisdiction. There is no floating content.

Supported levels:
- City / Town
- County
- State
- National

Jurisdictions determine who is responsible and which level of government can act.

---

## Place-first

A core Polyvox principle.

“Place-first” means civic content is always anchored to a real geographic jurisdiction, not abstract topics or national discourse.

This prevents confusion and makes accountability possible.

---

## Public Entity

A canonical target for civic accountability.

Public entities include:
- Offices (e.g., Mayor, City Council)
- Departments (e.g., Water Department, Public Works)
- Agencies (state or federal bodies)
- Officials (people currently holding offices)

Entities exist whether or not they have claimed a profile.

---

## Entity Tagging

The act of explicitly linking an issue, post, or question to a public entity.

Tagging ensures:
- the correct target is identified
- accountability is visible
- civic memory persists over time

Example: tagging a Water Department instead of complaining generically about water problems.

---

## Claimed Entity

A public entity that has been verified and claimed by an official or department representative.

Claiming a profile enables:
- notification preferences
- verified responses
- higher trust signaling

Unclaimed entities can still be referenced and tracked.

---

## Issue

A structured civic case file.

An Issue is not just a post or complaint. It includes:
- a jurisdiction
- a category
- optional entity tags
- evidence
- a lifecycle status

Issues are designed to persist until resolved or formally stalled.

---

## Issue Lifecycle

The status progression of an issue.

Typical statuses include:
- Open
- Verifying
- Actionable
- In Progress
- Resolved
- Stalled
- Disputed

This prevents issues from disappearing without accountability.

---

## Evidence

Supporting material attached to an issue.

Evidence can include:
- photos
- documents
- links
- timelines
- official responses

Evidence increases credibility and helps issues become actionable.

---

## Evidence Score

A system-generated measure of how well-supported an issue or cluster is.

Evidence scores consider:
- number and quality of attachments
- contributor diversity
- verification signals

Higher evidence scores are required for escalation.

---

## Cluster

A group of related issues across multiple jurisdictions.

Clusters represent systemic patterns rather than isolated incidents.

Clusters exist at:
- County level (multiple cities)
- State level (multiple counties)
- National level (multiple states)

---

## Systemic Pattern

A recurring civic failure or condition that appears in multiple places.

A systemic pattern indicates a structural problem, not a local anomaly.

Polyvox is designed to make systemic patterns visible.

---

## Escalation

The process of elevating an issue or cluster to a higher level of governance.

Escalation requires:
- repeated occurrences
- multiple contributors
- sufficient evidence

Escalation changes the target to the level of government that can fix the problem.

---

## Escalation Eligibility

A state where an issue or cluster meets the thresholds required to move up the Civic Ladder.

Eligibility does not automatically escalate content; it enables governed escalation.

---

## Governance Thresholds

Predefined requirements for actions like escalation.

Thresholds may include:
- number of jurisdictions affected
- number of unique contributors
- evidence score minimums
- moderation or community validation

Thresholds protect against abuse and noise.

---

## Solution

A portable proposal for fixing a civic problem.

Solutions are first-class objects in Polyvox and can attach to:
- individual issues
- clusters
- higher-level policy discussions

Solutions can travel upward just like problems.

---

## Solution Portability

The ability for a solution to apply across multiple jurisdictions.

A solution that works in one city can become a model for others.

---

## Civic Signal

A lightweight action that expresses civic intent without creating noise.

Examples include:
- confirming an issue exists
- prioritizing an issue
- supporting a solution
- nominating a candidate

Civic signals replace reaction-driven engagement.

---

## Reputation (Civic Reputation)

A trust-weighted measure of a user’s civic contribution over time.

Reputation is influenced by:
- evidence contributions
- constructive participation
- moderation reliability
- voting behavior patterns

Reputation affects vote weight but does not grant special authority.

---

## Vote Weighting

A mechanism that adjusts the impact of votes based on reputation and context.

Vote weighting reduces:
- brigading
- pile-ons
- chronic negativity

It promotes constructive participation over volume.

---

## Nominate-to-Run

A community mechanism for encouraging someone to consider running for office.

Nominations are signals, not ballots.
They help surface potential leaders early.

---

## Civic Portfolio

A public record of a person’s civic participation.

A portfolio may include:
- issues documented
- solutions proposed
- responses given
- trust earned

Portfolios allow leadership to emerge through contribution.

---

## In-App Notification

A notification delivered within Polyvox.

In-app notifications are the primary communication method for public entities and users.

---

## Email Digest

A batched email notification sent to verified public contact channels.

Email is:
- opt-in or digest-only by default
- throttled
- fully logged and auditable

Email is used carefully to prevent harassment.

---

## Notification Throttling

Limits placed on how often notifications can be sent.

Throttling protects public entities from spam and abuse.

---

## Audit Log

A permanent record of important actions.

Audit logs may include:
- escalation events
- notification deliveries
- moderation actions
- entity changes

Auditability is a core Polyvox principle.

---

## Moderation (Civic Moderation)

The enforcement of safety and integrity rules.

Polyvox moderation is:
- hard on abuse
- soft on disagreement
- transparent and auditable

Moderation exists to protect civic work, not silence dissent.

---

## Neutral Infrastructure

A core Polyvox design principle.

Polyvox does not enforce party alignment or ideology.
It structures civic reality and lets communities act on it.

---

## Write-in Pathway

One possible outcome of Polyvox, not its foundation.

Write-in campaigns may emerge where legally viable, but Polyvox creates value even where write-ins are restricted.

---

## Civic Literacy

Understanding how local government works and how to participate effectively.

Polyvox treats civic literacy as a core feature, not an afterthought.
