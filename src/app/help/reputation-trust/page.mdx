# Reputation and Trust

Reputation is a simple signal about how the community responds to your public participation. It is not a measure of political alignment, and it does not replace real elections.

## What reputation is

- A summary of how your posts are received over time.
- A signal that helps others interpret activity and context.
- A number that changes as the community votes and engages.

## What reputation is not

- It is not a political score.
- It is not a legal or official credential.
- It is not a replacement for election results.

## How it is calculated (high level)

Reputation considers net votes on your posts, your overall activity, and how long your account has existed. We keep the formula simple so it is explainable and auditable. Report penalties are not included yet.

For more definitions, see the [Glossary](/help/glossary).

## FAQ

### Can I lose reputation?

Yes. If your posts receive downvotes, your reputation can decrease. It can also go up if your posts receive upvotes.

### Does vote weight change election votes?

No. Vote weight only affects how we interpret activity inside Polyvox. It does not change official election results.

### Can I appeal moderation?

Appeals will be available in a future release. For now, contact support from the Help page.
