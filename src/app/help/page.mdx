# Polyvox Help Center

Welcome to Polyvox.

Polyvox is a civic platform designed to help communities identify problems, hold the right public entities accountable, and turn repeated local issues into real change — starting locally and scaling upward.

This help center explains:
- what Polyvox is (and what it is not)
- how civic issues move through the system
- how responsibility and accountability work
- how local truth becomes systemic evidence
- how leadership can emerge without money or party machines
