# Issues and Evidence

An Issue in Polyvox is not just a post.
It is a civic case file.

Each issue includes:
- a jurisdiction
- a category (housing, roads, elections, etc.)
- optional entity tags
- evidence and context
- a status lifecycle

## Evidence

Evidence can include:
- photos
- documents
- links
- timelines
- official responses

As evidence grows, issues become more actionable.
This prevents noise from overwhelming real problems.
