# Jurisdictions in Polyvox

Every action in Polyvox belongs to a jurisdiction.

## Supported levels
- City / Town
- County
- State
- National

There is no floating content.

This matters because:
- responsibility is clearer
- accountability is targeted
- patterns across places become visible

You always know:
- where an issue lives
- who can fix it
- what level of government should respond
