# Solutions and Change

Polyvox is not just for identifying problems.
Solutions are first-class objects.

Solutions can:
- attach to issues or clusters
- describe policies or operational fixes
- move upward just like problems

When a solution works in one place, it becomes visible elsewhere.

This is how reform spreads.
