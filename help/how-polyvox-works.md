# How Polyvox Works

Polyvox is built around a simple idea:

> Democracy fails when local truth cannot travel upward.

Polyvox solves this by creating a **Civic Ladder**.

## The Civic Ladder

Government is hierarchical:
- Cities handle local services
- Counties run elections, courts, and regional systems
- States set rules and funding structures
- National government controls broad standards and rights

Polyvox reflects this structure directly.

Every piece of content belongs to a place.
Issues start local and can move upward only when evidence and repetition justify it.

Escalation is earned, not viral.
