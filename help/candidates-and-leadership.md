# Candidates and Leadership

Polyvox supports leadership without money or party gatekeepers.

People build credibility by:
- documenting issues
- contributing evidence
- proposing solutions
- earning trust over time

Communities can nominate people to run for office.

Legitimacy comes from contribution, not ads.
