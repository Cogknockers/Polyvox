# Public Entities and Tagging

Polyvox makes civic conversation addressable.

Instead of yelling into the void, users can tag:
- offices (Mayor, City Council)
- departments (Water, Public Works)
- agencies
- officials

Entities exist even if no account has been claimed.

This ensures:
- correct targeting
- public accountability
- durable civic memory

Tagging helps turn frustration into action.
