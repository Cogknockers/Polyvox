# Clusters and Escalation

When the same issue appears in multiple places, Polyvox links them.

These linked issues form a **cluster**.

Clusters exist at:
- County level (multiple cities)
- State level (multiple counties)
- National level (multiple states)

Escalation requires:
- repeated occurrences
- multiple contributors
- sufficient evidence

This transforms anecdotes into systemic proof.
